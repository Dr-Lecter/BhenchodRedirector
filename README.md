# BhenchodRedirector
BhenchodRedirector is an open source popup redirector, its purpose is to allow scambaiters to quickly and easily find popups. It randomly redirects the user to a single site from an array in the redirect.php file. Users are free to modify this site, host it themselves, or add new sites to the array so long as the footer is not modified.
<h3>How to Setup</h3>
<p>Place both the Index.html, and Redirect.php files in the directory you wish them to be accesible from, when a user clicks the "Redirect to Scam Site" button the user will be redirected to redirect.php, at which point a randomy selected URL from the array will be selected, and finally the user will be forwarded to that site. If you wish to add, or modify the sites a user can be redirected to you must add them to the array in redirect.php
